### Description
Concept design of a savable day planner. Uses Luxon <https://moment.github.io/luxon/> in order to generate the current day at the top, as well as evaluate the current hour in the time slots. Past time slot(s) are gray, current time slot is green, and future slot(s) are orange. Hitting Save All will save each of the slots in local storage. Clear All removes local storage keys as well as clears the text fields in each hour. The Saved keys do not correspond to a specific day, only to their respective times. Flexible times slots may be available in the future as the slots are added dynamically with JS/JQuery, rather than being built into the HTML.
